# Product Acceptance And Execution Plan

## Preflight

**[R-RAS-ACCEPT-001]** Spec Status: active product/app authority under `.nimi/spec/project/kernel/**`.

**[R-RAS-ACCEPT-002]** Authority Owner: Realm Agent Studio app spec. Topic files are evidence only after
absorption here.

**[R-RAS-ACCEPT-003]** Work Type: alignment for implementation that follows this document; redesign
only when changing product scope, canonical owner surfaces, app architecture, or
admitted acceptance gates.

**[R-RAS-ACCEPT-004]** Parallel Truth: forbidden. This document is the current product acceptance and
execution authority for Realm Agent Studio. Conversation summaries, renderer
screenshots, passing tests, and topic notes are evidence, not acceptance truth.

## Standard

**[R-RAS-ACCEPT-005]** Realm Agent Studio is accepted only as an industrial desktop product for owners
operating public user-owned Realm Agents as durable Agent IP.

**[R-RAS-ACCEPT-006]** Passing renderer tests, wiring one feature, or showing a browser page is not
acceptance. Acceptance requires the whole owner workflow to be coherent:

- **[R-RAS-ACCEPT-007]** the app launches as a desktop app through the Nimi desktop / parentOS posture;
- **[R-RAS-ACCEPT-008]** account/session custody is owned by Runtime, not by app-local tokens;
- **[R-RAS-ACCEPT-009]** Realm and Runtime access goes through the SDK;
- **[R-RAS-ACCEPT-010]** the visible UI uses `nimi-kit` and shared interaction patterns as a system;
- **[R-RAS-ACCEPT-011]** every public success state is backed by admitted Realm or Runtime authority;
- **[R-RAS-ACCEPT-012]** AI is embedded inside real owner workflows and never bypasses human review;
- **[R-RAS-ACCEPT-013]** source failures preserve valid drafts and name the next valid action;
- **[R-RAS-ACCEPT-014]** no LocalAgent private state, generic world-created
  agent lane, creator/world-maintainer surface, fake return, or placeholder
  success leaks into the product. Forge-imported system curation and
  `WORLD_OWNED` management remain outside Realm Agent Studio.

## Acceptance Gates

| Gate | Required final acceptance | Current status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A0 Authority and scope | **[R-RAS-ACCEPT-015]** `.nimi/spec/project/kernel/**` contains the single active product/app authority, including acceptance gates. No topic file or conversation creates parallel truth. | W7 accepted. App-slice authority remains under this spec set; W7 evidence updates this document only and does not create parallel truth. |
| A1 Desktop app shell | **[R-RAS-ACCEPT-016]** App has a real desktop shell path comparable to `apps/parentos`: `dev:shell`, Tauri config, Rust shell bridge where needed, Runtime IPC transport, desktop account/session bootstrap, and no app-owned token fallback. Browser/Vite renderer is only a renderer development surface. | W7R accepted. `pnpm dev:realm:agent:studio` is a valid Studio Tauri shell entry and connects to an already-running external Runtime. Studio does not start/stop/restart Runtime or own Runtime config. Caller registration is backed by Platform Nimi App registry admission for `nimi.realm-agent-studio`. |
| A2 Platform UX system | **[R-RAS-ACCEPT-017]** First screen, navigation, loading, empty, error, form, review, and confirmation states are kit-first and platform-consistent. Custom UI is allowed only after a recorded kit gap. UI must not expose SDK route names, DTO names, raw payloads, or debug contract text as normal product copy. | W7 accepted for admitted surfaces. Workspace navigation, kit-first controls, review gates, fail-closed states, and disclosure-backed technical evidence are in place. |
| A3 Information architecture | **[R-RAS-ACCEPT-018]** Owner can move predictably between portfolio, create, agent detail, settings, assets, posts, and local schedule without a single mega-form. Navigation controls are functional, stateful, and do not imply unavailable surfaces. | W2 closed. Shell and in-page workspace controls are functional across Portfolio, Create, Agent Detail, Settings, Assets, Posts, and Local Schedule; tests assert workflows no longer render as one mega-surface. |
| A4 Owner portfolio and create | **[R-RAS-ACCEPT-019]** Portfolio list/filter/sort, create flow, handle preflight, OASIS/default world selection, selected-world preview, create confirmation, and post-create opening behavior are product-complete. Public draft fields are not silently dropped. | W3 closed. Portfolio/create/detail owner surfaces are complete for the admitted first-version scope; public bio is preserved as a post-create settings continuation instead of being silently submitted or dropped. |
| A5 Settings and rule-of-truth | **[R-RAS-ACCEPT-020]** Settings flow is natural-language-first plus structured fields, AI proposal/review where useful, field-to-layer clarity, human review, owner settings save, and no raw world-scoped `AgentRule` CRUD. | W4 closed. Runtime-assisted settings proposals are candidate-only, apply to visible fields for owner review, and save only through owner-scoped `MeService.updateMyRealmAgentSettings`. |
| A6 Creative identity assets | **[R-RAS-ACCEPT-021]** Avatar, profile cover/background, visual candidates, upload/generation, local history, owner review, public write success, and deferred public asset paths are clearly separated. App-local history is durable enough for the desktop product shape. | W5 closed for admitted surfaces. Avatar URL remains the only owner-reviewed public profile asset write; Runtime image candidates, identity Resource upload, voice-demo candidates, and app-local creative history are candidate-only. Profile cover/background and Resource-to-Agent binding publication remain explicitly deferred pending owner-scoped Realm ingress. |
| A7 Agent-authored posts | **[R-RAS-ACCEPT-022]** Owner can draft from agent voice, use AI assistance, attach canonical media, human-review, publish through Realm, and create a single local schedule that is actually persisted/executable or explicitly not admitted. | W6 closed for admitted surfaces. Post copy assistance is candidate-only, attachment and publish paths use Realm canonical services, and one app-local schedule is persisted per agent with foreground due execution. Realm publish success is claimed only after `PostsService.createPost` returns canonical post identity. |
| A8 Runtime AI consumption | **[R-RAS-ACCEPT-023]** Runtime AI support covers setting rewrite/proposal, visual/image generation candidates when available, post copy, voice demo, and source-backed suggestions through SDK surfaces. Runtime output remains candidate material until owner review. | W7 accepted for admitted surfaces. Settings proposals, visual candidates, voice-demo candidates, and post copy use Runtime SDK surfaces and remain owner-reviewed candidate material. Source-backed portfolio suggestions are explicitly deferred until an admitted owner-scoped suggestion surface exists. |
| A9 Failure and recovery | **[R-RAS-ACCEPT-024]** Every failure state preserves valid local work, names the unavailable source/capability in product terms, avoids pseudo-success, and gives a valid next action. | W7 accepted for admitted surfaces. Client and UI tests cover fail-closed Realm/Runtime/source failures, invalid output, unavailable transport, local schedule invalidity, and no pseudo-success. |
| A10 Verification evidence | **[R-RAS-ACCEPT-025]** Final closeout includes desktop-shell smoke, renderer screenshot only as secondary evidence, unit/integration tests, boundary checks, spec governance, no app REST bypass, Runtime-mediated Realm transport, and acceptance matrix results per gate. | Current hard cut supersedes W7R local bridge evidence. Studio uses `createNimiLocalFirstPartyRuntimeAccountCaller` and `runtime.account.invokeRealmUnary`; it must not own raw Realm tokens or an app-local Realm REST bridge. |

## Current Implementation Gap Audit

P0 gaps:

- The current UI is not an industrial product information architecture. It is a
  single long workspace where create, portfolio, settings, projection, media,
  voice, post, and schedule are all visible at once.
- Navigation is decorative. The side rail buttons do not route, select a
  workspace, or preserve user context.
- Authenticated account projection and owner Realm SDK calls have not yet been
  verified inside the desktop shell against a live owner session. W1 proves the
  shell/Runtime bridge path starts; W3 must prove the owner workflow inside it.

P1 gaps:

- `OwnerPortfolio.tsx` and `portfolio-client.ts` are too broad for sustained
  product iteration. Their size is a symptom of mixed workflow ownership, not a
  cosmetic refactor issue.
- AI support is still incomplete for source-backed portfolio suggestions. W4
  closed setting rewrite/proposal, W5 closed image/visual candidate generation,
  and W6 closed post-copy assistance as candidate-only Runtime output.
- Local post scheduling is a single persisted app-local schedule with foreground
  due execution after W6. It is not a recurring queue, campaign calendar, or
  Realm scheduling layer.
- Local creative asset history is app-local desktop storage after W5. It is not
  cross-device public truth.
- Create flow collects public bio as a local preview but does not persist it as
  part of the create/update sequence. That is product-confusing unless the flow
  explicitly continues into settings save.
- Visual identity is admitted for avatar URL save, Runtime image candidates,
  identity Resource upload, and local history. Profile cover/background writes
  and owner-scoped public Resource-to-Agent binding remain incomplete/deferred.
- Product UI still has diagnostic JSON previews in normal screens. Development
  diagnostics may exist, but launch UX must move them behind explicit developer
  disclosure or remove them.

P2 gaps:

- Renderer build still emits large chunk and circular chunk warnings. Not a
  current product blocker, but final acceptance should either fix or explicitly
  admit the tradeoff.
- Copy and labels are still mixed English/product-internal. Launch acceptance
  needs a deliberate language and terminology pass.
- Some source names remain in data objects and tests, which is acceptable for
  engineering evidence, but they must not leak into normal product copy.

## Waves

| Wave | State | Dependency | Closure goal | Acceptance closure |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| W0 Acceptance authority | active | none | **[R-RAS-ACCEPT-026]** Admit this product acceptance standard, gap audit, waves, and preflight. | This document exists, is indexed, and spec governance passes. |
| W1 Desktop shell hard cut | closed | W0 | **[R-RAS-ACCEPT-027]** Build a real desktop app shell equivalent in posture to parentOS: `src-tauri`, `dev:shell`, shell bridge/runtime defaults, desktop launch, Runtime session, SDK client custody. | A1 shell baseline passed. Renderer-only launch is no longer treated as product acceptance. |
| W2 Product information architecture | closed | W1 | **[R-RAS-ACCEPT-028]** Replace the single mega-surface with functional Studio workspaces: Portfolio, Create, Agent Detail, Settings, Assets, Posts, Local Schedule. | A2 and A3 passed with interaction evidence, local shell failure-state evidence, and verification commands. |
| W3 Owner portfolio/create/detail completion | closed | W2 | **[R-RAS-ACCEPT-029]** Finish owner list/filter/sort, create, world selection, post-create flow, detail state, friendCount, source failures, owner boundaries, and forbidden creator/world/system surface boundaries. | A4 and relevant A9 cases passed for portfolio/create/detail. |
| W4 Settings and AI proposal workflow | closed | W3 | **[R-RAS-ACCEPT-030]** Natural-language setting edits, Runtime-assisted proposal/rewrite, structured field review, owner settings save, no raw rule CRUD. | A5 and A8 settings subset passed. |
| W5 Creative identity and media workflow | closed | W3 | **[R-RAS-ACCEPT-031]** Avatar/profile cover strategy, visual/image candidates, upload, local durable history, clear blocked/deferred public asset publishing. | A6 and A8 visual subset passed for admitted surfaces; blocked Realm profile/binding publication is explicitly deferred. |
| W6 Agent post and local schedule | closed | W3 | **[R-RAS-ACCEPT-032]** Agent-authored post composer, AI copy assistance, attachments, human review, publish, and real app-local single schedule. | A7 and A8 post-copy subset passed. App-local schedule is persisted and foreground-executable when due. |
| W7 Final acceptance hardening | closed | W4, W5, W6 | **[R-RAS-ACCEPT-033]** Run complete acceptance matrix, desktop smoke, renderer screenshot, spec/boundary checks, copy pass, release-risk audit. | A0-A10 accepted for admitted Realm Agent Studio surfaces; deferred Realm-surface blockers and repo-wide non-Studio governance risks are recorded. |

**[R-RAS-ACCEPT-034]** Wave ordering follows `.nimi/methodology/wave-dag-policy.yaml`: upstream owner
and app shell decisions close before downstream feature fan-out. Parallelization
is allowed only after W2 if write sets do not conflict and the owner domain is
stable.

## Next Implementation Preflight

Before W1 implementation:

- **[R-RAS-ACCEPT-035]** Spec Status: active.
- **[R-RAS-ACCEPT-036]** Authority Owner: `.nimi/spec/project/kernel/**`.
- **[R-RAS-ACCEPT-037]** Work Type: alignment.
- **[R-RAS-ACCEPT-038]** Parallel Truth: forbidden.
- **[R-RAS-ACCEPT-039]** Required reads: `apps/parentos/package.json`,
  `apps/parentos/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`,
  `apps/parentos/src-tauri/Cargo.toml`,
  `apps/parentos/src/shell/renderer/infra/parentos-bootstrap.ts`,
  `apps/desktop/src-tauri/**` Runtime bridge patterns, and
  `kit/shell/tauri/**`.
- **[R-RAS-ACCEPT-040]** Stop if the implementation would require app-owned access tokens,
  `/api/creator/agents`, world-scoped `AgentRulesService`, `WorldControlService`
  owner substitution, LocalAgent private state, fake Runtime session, or fake
  desktop launch success.
- **[R-RAS-ACCEPT-041]** W1 must close with a desktop-shell smoke command and evidence. Renderer Vite
  screenshot alone is insufficient.

Before W2 implementation:

- **[R-RAS-ACCEPT-042]** W1 must be closed.
- **[R-RAS-ACCEPT-043]** Navigation, route/workspace ownership, local state ownership, and kit component
  usage must be specified before editing product screens.
- **[R-RAS-ACCEPT-044]** Stop if the design would keep all workflows in one giant page or introduce a
  parallel component system without a recorded `nimi-kit` gap.

Before W4-W6 implementation:

- **[R-RAS-ACCEPT-045]** Any missing Realm/Runtime owner surface must be classified as either
  deferred, newly admitted in Realm/Runtime, or removed from the active product
  flow. Do not work around missing surfaces with creator/world-maintainer APIs.

## Final Acceptance Package

Final closeout must report:

- **[R-RAS-ACCEPT-046]** Findings: no P0/P1 unresolved product gaps except explicitly deferred external
  Realm/Runtime surfaces.
- **[R-RAS-ACCEPT-047]** Current Phase Disposition: `complete`, `partial`, or `deferred` per
  `.nimi/contracts/acceptance.schema.yaml`.
- **[R-RAS-ACCEPT-048]** Evidence Sufficiency: exact commands and visual/desktop evidence.
- **[R-RAS-ACCEPT-049]** Acceptance Matrix: A0-A10 status with file references and evidence.
- **[R-RAS-ACCEPT-050]** Next Step or Reopen Condition: exact blocker or follow-up wave.

## W1 Closure Evidence

W1 closed on 2026-05-22 with:

- `apps/realm-agent-studio/src-tauri/**` desktop shell admitted.
- Root `pnpm dev:realm:agent:studio` routed to app `dev:shell`.
- Renderer installs the Tauri Runtime hook before bootstrap.
- Realm base URL is resolved from desktop Runtime defaults when Tauri IPC is
  available.
- `pnpm --filter @nimiplatform/realm-agent-studio typecheck` passed.
- `cd apps/realm-agent-studio/src-tauri && cargo check` passed.
- `pnpm --filter @nimiplatform/realm-agent-studio test` passed.
- `pnpm --filter @nimiplatform/realm-agent-studio build:renderer` passed with
  existing chunk/circular warnings.
- `pnpm check:no-app-realm-rest-bypass` passed.
- SDK/Runtime account access used no app-owned Realm token path.
- `pnpm exec nimicoding validate-spec-governance --profile nimi --scope
  apps/realm-agent-studio` passed.
- Desktop shell smoke: with an existing renderer on port 1426, `cargo run`
  entered `target/debug/nimiplatform-realm-agent-studio` and logged
  `realm-agent-studio main() entered`; the process was then terminated.

The app is not accepted until W7 closes.

## W2 Closure Evidence

W2 closed on 2026-05-22 with:

- `apps/realm-agent-studio/src/shell/renderer/app-shell/shell-layout.tsx`
  owns the admitted Studio workspace set and functional shell navigation:
  Portfolio, Create, Detail, Settings, Assets, Posts, and Schedule.
- `apps/realm-agent-studio/src/shell/renderer/App.tsx` owns active workspace
  state and passes it through the shell and product workspace.
- `apps/realm-agent-studio/src/shell/renderer/features/portfolio/OwnerPortfolio.tsx`
  renders create, portfolio, agent detail, settings, assets, posts, and local
  schedule as separate stateful workspaces instead of one long page. Selecting
  an agent preserves context and opens the detail lane from portfolio/create.
- Raw review payloads touched in W2 were moved behind explicit technical
  disclosure controls so they are no longer primary launch copy.
- `apps/realm-agent-studio/src/shell/renderer/features/portfolio/OwnerPortfolio.visibility.test.tsx`
  now covers workspace navigation and asserts that portfolio, settings, posts,
  and schedule are not rendered as a single mega-surface.
- `pnpm --filter @nimiplatform/realm-agent-studio typecheck` passed.
- `pnpm --filter @nimiplatform/realm-agent-studio test` passed with 8 files and
  110 tests.
- `pnpm --filter @nimiplatform/realm-agent-studio build:renderer` passed with
  the pre-existing large chunk, empty sdk-realm chunk, and circular chunk
  warnings still carried to W7 risk audit.
- `pnpm check:no-app-realm-rest-bypass` passed.
- SDK/Runtime account access used no app-owned Realm token path.
- `pnpm exec nimicoding validate-spec-governance --profile nimi --scope
  apps/realm-agent-studio` passed.
- `pnpm exec nimicoding generate-spec-derived-docs --profile nimi --scope
  spec-human-doc --check` passed. The narrower
  `generate-spec-derived-docs --scope apps/realm-agent-studio --check` command
  is not supported by the current nimicoding package and was refused before
  writing files.
- Local renderer smoke on `http://127.0.0.1:1426/` returned HTTP 200. A Safari
  Computer Use check showed the renderer fail-closed at the Runtime account
  session gate outside Tauri/desktop Runtime custody. This is supporting
  failure-state evidence only and is not product acceptance.

W2 closure does not claim final product acceptance. W3 remains responsible for
live owner portfolio/create/detail completion inside the desktop owner session.

## W3 Closure Evidence

W3 closed on 2026-05-22 with:

- `CreateRealmAgentWorkspace` emits a post-create context only after a real
  `Realm AgentsService.agentControllerCreate` result with canonical id and, when
  a reviewed profile description exists, source-backed owner settings completion.
- Successful create opens the created agent's owner detail lane and keeps
  selected-agent context even before the refreshed portfolio list contains the
  new id.
- Profile description is the single public description field. It is submitted as
  `CreateAgentDto.description` and verified or completed through
  `MeService.updateMyRealmAgentSettings`; Studio no longer preserves a local
  post-create public-bio handoff.
- Owner detail can fetch the selected created id directly through
  `MeService.getMyRealmAgent`; portfolio list order/filter/sort remains
  app-local view state and does not create queue or lifecycle truth.
- The W3 UI test covers create submit, canonical create confirmation,
  post-create detail opening, profile-description completion, and create body
  allowlist behavior.
- `pnpm --filter @nimiplatform/realm-agent-studio typecheck` passed.
- `pnpm --filter @nimiplatform/realm-agent-studio test` passed with 8 files and
  111 tests.
- `pnpm --filter @nimiplatform/realm-agent-studio build:renderer` passed with
  the existing chunk warnings still carried to W7 risk audit.
- `pnpm check:no-app-realm-rest-bypass` passed.
- SDK/Runtime account access used no app-owned Realm token path.

W3 closure does not claim settings, asset, post, schedule, or final product
acceptance. W4 remains responsible for the settings and AI proposal workflow.

## W4 Closure Evidence

W4 closed on 2026-05-22 with:

- Owner settings remain natural-language-first plus structured visible fields.
- Runtime settings assistance uses `runtime.ai.text.generate` through the SDK
  runtime client. The concrete route is bound through the Studio NimiAIConfig
  `text.generate` targetRef; no env model fallback or provider/model literal is
  admitted in the product path.
- Runtime output is parsed as candidate JSON, rejected on forbidden fields
  (`provider`, `model`, `LocalAgent`, lifecycle/state/world/profile asset
  fields, raw `agentRules`, and related keys), and applied only into admitted
  visible draft fields.
- Runtime proposal failure preserves the current owner draft and names Runtime
  text generation as the unavailable capability.
- Saving still requires human review and uses only
  `MeService.updateMyRealmAgentSettings`; raw `AgentRulesService` CRUD remains
  absent and deferred.
- Tests cover proposal prompt construction, candidate normalization, forbidden
  Runtime output rejection, SDK `runtime.ai.text.generate` use, fail-closed
  missing model config, UI proposal application, and owner settings save.
- `pnpm --filter @nimiplatform/realm-agent-studio typecheck` passed.
- `pnpm --filter @nimiplatform/realm-agent-studio test` passed with 8 files and
  117 tests.
- `pnpm --filter @nimiplatform/realm-agent-studio build:renderer` passed with
  the existing chunk warnings still carried to W7 risk audit.
- `pnpm check:no-app-realm-rest-bypass` passed.
- SDK/Runtime account access used no app-owned Realm token path.

W4 closure does not claim visual/image generation, creative media history, post
copy assistance, local schedule, or final product acceptance. W5 remains
responsible for creative identity and media workflow.

## W5 Closure Evidence

W5 closed on 2026-05-22 with:

- The Assets workspace separates public avatar URL save from candidate-only
  visual identity work. Avatar URL selection remains the only admitted public
  profile asset write and still uses `AgentsService.agentControllerSelectAvatar`.
- Runtime image assistance uses SDK `media.image.generate` with configured model
  input and owner-approved public/profile context only. Output is local candidate
  material with `publicTruth=false`.
- Identity image upload creates/finalizes a Realm `Resource(IMAGE)` for local
  identity review through `ResourcesService` direct upload and `finalizeResource`.
  It does not claim profile cover, avatar binding, feed, or public profile
  publication.
- App-local creative history persists Runtime image candidates, identity
  Resource uploads, and voice-demo candidates per agent in desktop local storage.
  History records are explicitly local and rejected if they claim public truth.
- Profile cover/background write and Resource-to-Agent presentation Binding
  publication remain deferred until Realm admits an owner-scoped ingress. Studio
  still does not use `WorldControlService`.
- Tests cover Runtime image request shaping, malformed image output failure,
  identity Resource upload metadata, durable local creative history, UI image
  generation, UI identity upload, existing avatar URL selection, and voice-demo
  candidate behavior.
- `pnpm --filter @nimiplatform/realm-agent-studio typecheck` passed.
- `pnpm --filter @nimiplatform/realm-agent-studio test` passed with 9 files and
  127 tests.
- `pnpm --filter @nimiplatform/realm-agent-studio build:renderer` passed with
  the existing chunk warnings still carried to W7 risk audit.
- `pnpm check:no-app-realm-rest-bypass` passed.
- SDK/Runtime account access used no app-owned Realm token path.
- `pnpm exec nimicoding validate-spec-governance --profile nimi --scope
  apps/realm-agent-studio` passed.
- `pnpm exec nimicoding generate-spec-derived-docs --profile nimi --scope
  spec-human-doc --check` passed.

W5 closure does not claim post copy assistance, durable executable schedule, or
final product acceptance. W6 remains responsible for agent-authored posts and
local schedule workflow.

## W6 Closure Evidence

W6 closed on 2026-05-22 with:

- Runtime post-copy assistance uses SDK `runtime.ai.text.generate` with the
  Studio NimiAIConfig `text.generate` targetRef. Runtime output is candidate
  material only, applies into editable caption/tag fields, and clears human
  review before publish.
- Post publishing still uses only `PostsService.createPost` with `CreatePostDto`
  fields `attachments`, `caption`, and `tags`. Studio does not submit
  caller-owned `worldId`, `authorId`, post id, schedule id, queue, campaign, or
  recurrence fields.
- Media attachments remain canonical attachment envelopes over READY/readable
  Resource/Asset/Bundle targets. Text and media Resource helpers remain separate
  from public profile asset publication.
- The Local Schedule workspace persists one app-local schedule per agent in
  desktop local storage. The schedule is foreground-executable only when due and
  clears only after Realm publish succeeds. Local scheduling is not Realm schedule
  truth and is not public post success.
- Failure handling preserves draft/schedule state for Runtime unavailability,
  invalid AI output, invalid local schedule times, and Realm publish failures.
- Tests cover post-copy prompt construction, proposal normalization/rejection,
  SDK `runtime.ai.text.generate` use, fail-closed missing post-copy model config,
  UI post-copy application, single local schedule persistence, due-state
  execution gating, and existing publish/attachment boundaries.
- `pnpm --filter @nimiplatform/realm-agent-studio typecheck` passed.
- `pnpm --filter @nimiplatform/realm-agent-studio test` passed with 10 files and
  136 tests.
- `pnpm --filter @nimiplatform/realm-agent-studio build:renderer` passed with
  the existing chunk warnings still carried to W7 risk audit.
- `pnpm check:no-app-realm-rest-bypass` passed.
- SDK/Runtime account access used no app-owned Realm token path.
- `pnpm exec nimicoding validate-spec-governance --profile nimi --scope
  apps/realm-agent-studio` passed.
- `pnpm exec nimicoding generate-spec-derived-docs --profile nimi --scope
  spec-human-doc --check` passed.

W6 closure does not claim final product acceptance. W7 remains responsible for
complete A0-A10 hardening, desktop smoke, copy pass, and release-risk audit.

## W7 Closure Evidence

W7 closed on 2026-05-22 with:

- Final hardening stayed in `Work Type=alignment` under
  `.nimi/spec/project/kernel/**`; no topic, renderer result, or conversation
  note was promoted to parallel product truth.
- The owner portfolio renderer was split by workflow ownership into bounded
  Portfolio, Settings, Assets, Posts, and shared modules. The SDK client was
  split into core owner/create, settings/projection, media/avatar, and
  post/resource modules. The oversized client test was split into workflow
  tests with shared fixtures. Studio-specific AI governance oversize errors are
  gone.
- `@tauri-apps/api` is aligned to the available Tauri 2.11 minor
  (`^2.11.0`) used by the Rust shell dependency line. The W7 desktop smoke no
  longer emits the prior Tauri 2.11.2 / JS 2.10.1 minor mismatch warning.
- Real desktop smoke ran through `pnpm exec tauri dev --config
  src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` from `apps/realm-agent-studio`. Vite opened
  `http://127.0.0.1:1426/`, Cargo launched
  `target/debug/nimiplatform-realm-agent-studio`, dotenv loaded, and the binary
  logged `realm-agent-studio main() entered`. The process was then terminated
  after evidence capture; renderer success alone was not used as acceptance.
- `pnpm --filter @nimiplatform/realm-agent-studio typecheck` passed.
- `pnpm --filter @nimiplatform/realm-agent-studio test` passed with 13 files and
  136 tests.
- `pnpm --filter @nimiplatform/realm-agent-studio build` passed, including
  renderer production build and Tauri `cargo check`. The existing large-chunk,
  circular-chunk, and empty `sdk-realm` renderer warnings remain release-risk
  items, not current acceptance blockers.
- `pnpm check:no-retired-methodology-refs` passed.
- `pnpm check:no-legacy-imports` passed.
- `pnpm check:no-absolute-user-paths` passed.
- `pnpm check:no-app-realm-rest-bypass` passed.
- SDK/Runtime account access used no app-owned Realm token path.
- `pnpm exec nimicoding validate-spec-governance --profile nimi --scope
  apps/realm-agent-studio` passed.
- `pnpm exec nimicoding generate-spec-derived-docs --profile nimi --scope
  spec-human-doc --check` passed.
- `pnpm nimicoding:validate-ai-governance --profile nimi --scope all` still
  fails on pre-existing repo-wide files outside Realm Agent Studio, including
  `.nimi/spec/runtime/kernel/runtime-agent-service-contract.md`,
  `apps/desktop/**`, `runtime/**`, and `sdk/**` oversized-file errors. The rerun
  no longer reports Studio files as errors.

## W7R Desktop Session Regression Closure

Trigger: manager desktop smoke previously found that `pnpm dev:realm:agent:studio`
could open the Tauri shell while the Realm access path still depended on
app-local bridge ownership. The current hard cut replaces that path with the
Runtime account Realm unary mediation surface.

Closure:

- Studio caller authority is documented in `.nimi/spec/project/kernel/index.md`
  as `nimi.realm-agent-studio` /
  `nimi.realm-agent-studio.local-first-party` /
  `ACCOUNT_CALLER_MODE_LOCAL_FIRST_PARTY_APP`.
- Studio Tauri shell no longer exposes a custom Realm HTTP bridge command.
  Realm calls go through `runtime.account.invokeRealmUnary` with Runtime-owned
  account/session mediation.
- Studio Tauri shell still assumes Runtime is already running, matching its
  product boundary as a satellite desktop app rather than the core Desktop app.
- Runtime registry truth remains in the Runtime launch path, not in Studio.

W7R verification:

- `go test ./internal/appregistrycatalog ./internal/grpcserver
  ./internal/services/auth -run
  'TestLoadRegistry_ParsesValidYAML|TestLoadNimiAppRegistryCatalog|TestRegisterAppAdmitsRealmAgentStudioDeveloperShellCaller|TestCheckCallerEligibility'
  -count=1` passed from `runtime/`.
- `pnpm --filter @nimiplatform/realm-agent-studio typecheck` passed.
- `pnpm --filter @nimiplatform/realm-agent-studio test` passed with 13 files
  and 136 tests.
- `cd apps/realm-agent-studio/src-tauri && cargo check` passed.
- `pnpm check:no-app-realm-rest-bypass` passed.
- Boundary checks passed for no app-owned Realm token transport and no local
  Realm REST bridge.
- External Runtime smoke evidence must prove `runtime.account.invokeRealmUnary`
  mediation; prior local bridge evidence is no longer accepted as current
  authority.
- Studio desktop smoke: launched
  `NIMI_RUNTIME_GRPC_ADDR=127.0.0.1:46381
  NIMI_RUNTIME_HTTP_ADDR=127.0.0.1:46382
  pnpm dev:realm:agent:studio`; the Tauri app reached the owner Studio UI with
  Runtime account projection and no `APP_NOT_REGISTERED` /
  `registration rejected: 5`.

Residual verification note:

- `pnpm generate:platform-catalog --check` / `node
  scripts/check-platform-catalog-drift.mjs` still fail because
  `.nimi/spec/platform/kernel/tables/ai-profile-factory-catalog.yaml` has
  pre-existing unprojected AI-profile changes unrelated to Realm Agent Studio.
  The Studio registry row is manually reflected in the generated Desktop Nimi
  App registry projections in this wave; the unrelated AI-profile drift remains
  outside this wave's commit boundary.

Deferred blockers and risks carried after W7:

- **[R-RAS-ACCEPT-051]** Source-backed portfolio suggestions remain deferred until an admitted
  owner-scoped Realm/Runtime suggestion surface exists.
- **[R-RAS-ACCEPT-052]** Profile cover/background publication and Resource-to-Agent Binding public
  truth remain deferred until Realm admits an owner-scoped binding ingress.
- **[R-RAS-ACCEPT-053]** Local scheduling remains a single app-local foreground schedule, not Realm
  schedule truth, recurrence, campaign, or queue state.
- **[R-RAS-ACCEPT-054]** Renderer bundle-size warnings remain release-risk debt for later chunking
  work; they do not alter the owner authority or product truth model.

W7 accepts Realm Agent Studio final product scope for the admitted W2-W7 owner
surfaces. Acceptance still excludes the deferred Realm surfaces named above and
does not claim repo-wide AI governance completion outside this app.
